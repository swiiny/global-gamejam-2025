# Path of Silence

Welcome to **Path of Silence**, our submission for the **Global Game Jam 2025**! ðŸŽ®  
The theme for this yearâ€™s event was **"Bubbles"**, and our game reflects this both metaphorically and in gameplay mechanics.

## ðŸ•Š Game Description

Step into medieval Europe around the year 1000, where superstition and solitude shape the lives of the abandoned. In **Path of Silence**, you play as **Sindo**, a boy rejected by his family and left at a monastery, condemned to a life of isolation.

Through **stealth and exploration**, experience a poignant story as Sindo navigates the cruelty and rejection of his peers. When another orphan offers him a rare moment of empathy, Sindo is forced to confront his belief in his own worth. Yet, consumed by doubt, he chooses to flee, unable to accept the connection he thought was beyond his reach.

**Will Sindo pierce the bubble of isolation in which the world tries to keep him?**

### ðŸ•¹ Gameplay Mechanics

- Avoid the **bubbles** of people sleeping nearby to help Sindo sneak out of his room.
- Engage in stealth-based exploration to uncover the story of Sindoâ€™s isolation and internal struggle.
